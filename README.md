### gdx-liftoff: Credits

The project was forked from the [`czyzby/gdx-setup`](https://github.com/czyzby/gdx-setup) repository.
[@czyzby](https://github.com/czyzby) and [@kotcrab](https://github.com/kotcrab) created the original application,
as well as a set of libraries that it depends on (`gdx-lml` and `VisUI` respectively). Since then, the project is
maintained by [@tommyettinger](https://github.com/tommyettinger). Graciously, czyzby came back and made a wide variety of improvements, so big
thanks there! Thanks also to [@metaphore](https://github.com/metaphore), who now maintains gdx-lml (which this used and may still use).

[@raeleus](https://github.com/raeleus) created the
[Particle Park skin for scene2d.ui](https://ray3k.wordpress.com/particle-park-ui-skin-for-scene2d-ui/),
which was adapted to be the default skin added to new projects (if the _"Generate UI Assets"_ option is selected).
"Accademia di Belle Arti di Urbino and students of MA course of Visual design" has created the _Titillium Web_
font that the skin uses (under SIL OFL license). Oh yeah, and he did some other stuff starting in version 1.12.1.10,
such as *almost the entire release*. Huge thanks to raeleus for the complete overhaul of the user experience!

Other project contributors include [@Mr00Anderson](https://github.com/Mr00Anderson), [@lyze237](https://github.com/lyze237),
[@metaphore](https://github.com/metaphore) (again!), and [@payne911](https://github.com/payne911).
People who haven't directly contributed code have still helped a lot by spending their time to test on platforms
like macOS and iOS; [@JojoIce](https://github.com/JojoIce) is one of several people who made a difference regarding iOS. And of course,
many thanks go to all the early adopters for putting up with any partially-working releases early on!

The randomized icons chopped up and used for Android projects come from the [OpenMoji](https://openmoji.org) project.
If you want to use these icons in a less-mangled format, there's
[openmoji-atlas](https://github.com/tommyettinger/openmoji-atlas) to access these emoji from libGDX conveniently.

Thanks also to everyone who has made the various libraries and tools Liftoff depends upon. From the huge team
responsible for Graal Native Image, to [Construo](https://github.com/fourlastor-alexandria/construo) by pretty much a
[team of one](https://github.com/fourlastor), some of the best features of Liftoff aren't in Liftoff code at all.
